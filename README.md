# libraries-workshops

I'm trying to improve my Python skills a bit by writing small(ish) scripts. This is my first attempt towards that goal.
This script displays the workshops occurring at NCSU Libaries that are displayed on the first page of the NCSU Library
Workshops page. The script was also a way for me to get a little bit of experience with using Beautiful Soup, which I'd heard of,
but never used before now.

I've already noticed that there are some issues with the script that I will likely fix in the near future.
